The AI engineer's work trajectory can be divided into two major phases. Initially, the engineer began developing a full-stack application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, adhering to the provided Green-ai design guidelines. This phase involved creating a mock-data driven frontend funnel and setting up a basic backend with authentication and data models. Several issues were encountered and resolved, primarily related to frontend component rendering (Lucide React) and backend data modeling/authentication (Pydantic v2, bcrypt password hashing).

A significant pivot occurred with Chat Message 134, where the user provided a completely new and detailed product specification for MicroGardenLife, mandating a Next.js (App Router) stack with MongoDB Atlas, Stripe, Resend, and Cloudflare R2, focusing on a cookie-based, no-user-account model. The AI engineer promptly adapted, scrapping the previous React/FastAPI work and building the new Next.js application from scratch.

The subsequent work focused on implementing the Next.js architecture, including pages, API routes, and core utilities. This phase was characterized by extensive debugging of Next.js hydration issues (e.g., dynamic content, date formatting,  checks) and persistent styling problems due to conflicts between TailwindCSS and Turbopack. The engineer ultimately resolved these by disabling Turbopack, removing TailwindCSS, and implementing styles using pure CSS, ensuring the application is visually functional and stable. The current state is a functional, styled Next.js frontend, ready for advanced backend integrations.

<product_requirements>
The product is a production-ready, mobile-first sales funnel for MicroGardenLife, a brand selling microgreens. The funnel consists of three main steps:
1.  **Capture Page ()**: A minimalist lead magnet page offering a free guide, requiring email (optional first name) and GDPR consent. It posts to  and redirects to the book landing page.
2.  **Book Landing Page ()**: Sells an ebook for 17€, with a book mockup, compelling copy, trust badges, key benefits, table of contents, FAQ, and social proof. The CTA leads to Stripe Checkout.
3.  **Upsell Page ()**: Sells a video training for 67€, detailing modules, bonuses, and a CTA to Stripe Checkout.

**Core Principles**: Minimalist, nature-lifestyle, premium design, generous whitespace, rounded corners (12px), soft shadows.
**Branding**: GREEN\_PRIMARY: #1A4D2E, CREAM\_BG: #F5F1E8, GRAY\_CONCRETE: #D9D9D9, ANTHRACITE: #1C1C1C, YELLOW\_ACCENT: #E6B800. Titles: Montserrat (700/600), Body: Lato (400/500).
**Architecture**: Next.js (App Router), MongoDB Atlas, Stripe, Resend, Cloudflare R2. No user accounts, lifetime access delivered via magic links (short TTL) and long-lived JWT httpOnly session cookies (~10 years). Content served via short-lived signed URLs from R2.
**Backend**: APIs for lead capture, Stripe webhooks, activation, access token generation, and content delivery ().
**Admin Mini Panel**: (Future) List orders/leads/logs, revoke orders, resend activation.
**Emails**: HTML+TXT templates for post-purchase activation and freebie delivery via Resend.
**Security**: JWT (httpOnly), signed URLs, rate limiting, refund mechanism (revoking orders), abuse detection.
**PDF Watermark**: Ebook PDFs will be personalized with user email/order ID using .
**Video Delivery**: HLS videos hosted on R2/S3 with signed URLs, frontend watermark overlay.
**Stripe Setup**: Two products (book 17€, video 67€) with specific metadata.
**SEO**: Unique H1 per page, semantic structure, OG tags, favicon, manifest.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical styling and rendering issues in the newly built Next.js application for MicroGardenLife. The user reported that the website was not displaying correctly, only showing text without styles.

The key actions taken were:
1.  **Identifying the root cause**: The problem was diagnosed as a conflict between TailwindCSS and Turbopack within Next.js 15, preventing CSS from loading and applying correctly.
2.  **Configuration adjustments**: A  file was created and modified to manage CSS loading.
3.  **Removal of conflicting tools**: To ensure stability, the decision was made to entirely disable **Turbopack** and remove all **TailwindCSS** dependencies and configuration. This involved removing , , and related packages from , and configuring  to run Next.js without Turbopack.
4.  **Transition to Pure CSS**: The styling approach was completely converted to pure CSS. The  file was rewritten to contain all necessary styles directly, adhering to the MicroGardenLife branding (colors, typography, component styles).
5.  **Fixing CSS parsing errors**: Minor issues with CSS parsing (e.g., escaped backslashes in class names) were identified and corrected in .

The outcome of this work is a functional MicroGardenLife Next.js frontend, styled correctly using pure CSS, with no visible hydration errors or styling issues, making it visually complete and stable. The AI engineer successfully tested the homepage, book page, and upsell page, confirming the design is now soigné (neat).
